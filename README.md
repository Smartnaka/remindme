# Lecture Reminder App 🎓

> **Internal Codename:** RemindMe  
> **Version:** 1.0.0

A modern, intuitive mobile application built with **React Native** and **Expo** to help students manage their academic schedules, exams, and assignments.

**Core Value Proposition:** Never miss a lecture again with a smart hybrid notification system (Calendar + Alarm) that works reliably across iOS and Android.

## ✨ Features

- **📅 Smart Scheduling**: Easily add and organize your weekly and bi-weekly lectures, as well as track assignments and exams.
- **🔔 Advanced Hybrid Reminders**:
  - _Cross-Platform:_ Works reliably via local notifications for iOS and exact alarms for Android.
  - _Customization:_ Set notification offsets for your classes, assignments, and exams.
  - _Quiet Hours & Semester Limits:_ Automatically silence notifications outside class terms or during the night.
  - _Daily Summary:_ Get a morning brief of your classes and assignments for the day.
- **🎨 Personalization**:
  - Assign custom colors to courses for quick visual identification.
  - `Light` / `Dark` / `Automatic` themes.
  - `Reduce Motion` support for accessible screen transitions.
- **💾 Complete Data Control**:
  - Offline-first architecture utilizing local storage.
  - Export all your app data (Lectures, Exams, Assignments, Settings) to JSON.
  - Safely clear out data when a semester ends.
- **⚡ Haptic UI**: Tactile interactions for saving, errors, and selection events.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

- **Framework**: [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/)
- **Platform**: [Expo SDK 54](https://expo.dev/) (Managed Workflow)
- **Routing**: `expo-router` (File-based navigation)
- **State Management**: React Context (`LectureContext`, `SettingsContext`)
- **Data Persistence**: `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage`
- **Date Handling**: `dayjs`
- **Styling**: `StyleSheet` with custom design tokens.

```

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: (LTS version recommended)
- **Expo Go**: Installed on your physical device (iOS/Android).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd lecture-reminder-app
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    > **IMPORTANT:** This project relies on an `.npmrc` file to set `legacy-peer-deps=true`. This is required to resolve a conflict between `React 19` and `lucide-react-native`.

    ```bash
    npm install
    # OR if you prefer to be explicit
    npm install --legacy-peer-deps
    ```

3.  **Start the server:**
    ```bash
    npx expo start
    ```
    - Press `a` to run on Android Emulator.
    - Press `i` to run on iOS Simulator.
    - Scan the QR code with Expo Go to run on physical device.

## 🔧 Scripts

- `npm start`: specific alias for `expo start`.
- `npm run android`: specific alias for `expo start --android`.
- `npm run ios`: specific alias for `expo start --ios`.
- `npm run web`: specific alias for `expo start --web`.


## 🧭 Sentry Configuration

This project is configured to use the Sentry project **`remind-me`** in the **`smart-tech-ph`** organization.

### Automatic setup (recommended)

Run the Sentry wizard from the project root:

```bash
npx @sentry/wizard@latest -i reactNative --saas --org smart-tech-ph --project remind-me
```

### DSN

If your app already has Sentry integration and only needs this project DSN:

```text
https://1aa5a21626fdb4d87540b29d07331284@o4511119194521600.ingest.de.sentry.io/4511120867852368
```

Sentry project metadata is recorded in `app.json` under `expo.extra.sentry`, and org/project defaults are in `sentry.properties`. Add the Sentry package and plugin only after dependencies can be installed in your environment.

## 🧪 Troubleshooting

### 1. `ERESOLVE` or Peer Dependency Error

If you see an error about `lucide-react-native` and `react@19`:

- **Fix:** Ensure the `.npmrc` file exists in the root directory with `legacy-peer-deps=true`.
- **Manual Fix:** Run `npm install --legacy-peer-deps`.

### 2. Notifications not firing on Android

- **Cause:** Battery optimization often kills background processes.
- **Fix:** This app requests `SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM` permissions. Ensure you grant it notifications access when prompted on the first launch.

### 3. "Port already in use"

- **Cause:** Another Metro bundler instance is running.
- **Fix:** Run `npx expo start --clear` to reset the cache and use a new port.
